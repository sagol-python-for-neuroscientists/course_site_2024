HW1 Question 1 Solution

This is by far not the fastest solution, but I wanted to show
you how I divide the question into a main function (trifeca)
and a smaller function (_three_pairs_in_a_row) that does the "heavy
lifting".

    Parameters
    ----------

    word : string
        Word to check the condition

    -------
    value : bool
        True if input contained three consecutive double-letter pairs,
