1. _Duplicates Discovery:_
   Define a class that scans through a folder with all of its subfolders and returns the following:

- Names and content of the unique files. "Unique" in this sense means, that if two files - `a.txt` and `b.tif` for example -
  have the same content, only the first should be included in this "uniques" list, while the second (`b.tif`) can be discarded.
- Names of the "parent" files and their duplicates, held together in a dictionary. In the example above, the parent file
  is `a.txt`, since it was first in line, and its duplicate is `b.tif`. If another file with the same content as `a.txt` and `b.tif`
  will be found it will be added to that dictionary under `a.txt` again.

Note: Please use the `pathlib` module we showed in class, and not the `os` module.

```python
class FolderIterator:
    """.Iterates through the supplied folder, finding duplicates.

    Call the iter_folder() method to parse the directory.

    Attributes
    ----------
    foldername : path-like
        Name of base folder to iterate on.
    uniques : list
        A list of unique files in the folder and their content.
    duplicates : dict
        The keys are the parent files and the values are a list of filenames
        with the same content.
    """
    def __init__(self, foldername='base'):
        self.foldername = ...  # pathlib.Path instance
        self.uniques = ...  # list instance
        self.duplicates = ...  # dict instance
        # Other attributes may follow

    def iter_folder(self):
        """Main function to find duplicate and unique files in the filesystem."""
        pass

```

The folder in question is `base`, also located in this repo.

2. _The Time Class:_

   - Define the `Time` class:

   ```python
   class Time:
       """
       Represents the time of the day.
       Attributes: hour, minute, second
       """
   ```

   - Give default values to the `__init__` function.
   - Validate that the input fits a 24 hour clock. Think of as many edge-cases as you can. If the input
     isn't valid reset that value to 0.
   - Override the `__str__` method so that when you print a Time instance it prints out nicely.
   - Define a `Time().is_after(other_time)` method. that returns `True` if the first `Time()` is later
     than the `other_time` instance, and `False` otherwise. `00:00:00` is the earliest, `23:59:59` is the latest.
   - Overload the `__add__` operator to allow the addition of two `Time` instances.
     - Make sure you deal with all possible cases - "overflow" of minutes
       and seconds, and that after `23:59:59` comes `00:00:00`.

3. _Basic `numpy` Calculations:_

   Saving and loading `numpy` arrays is done using the functions `np.load`, `np.save` and `np.savez`. A single array is saved in the `.npy` format using `np.save`, while a dictionary of arrays is saved to the `.npz` format using `np.savez`. Both data structures can be read using `np.load`. In the repo you can see `data.npy`, a single 4D array that I randomly generated. The file `hw3_q3.py` should contain functions that take this specific array as input.

   i. Define the `load_data` function which receives a filename and returns the array.

   ```python
   def load_data(fname: str):
       """ Load and return an '.npy' file """
   ```

   ii. Find and return all numbers within the range (0.3, 0.4) in the array. Note: exclusive on both ends.

   ```python
   def find_in_range(data: np.ndarray, num_range: tuple=(0.3, 0.4)):
       """ Return an array containing the values of 'data' that are inside 'num_range' """
   ```

   iii. Return the index of the first value larger than 0.9, the input value. The index is a
   `numpy` array with one dimension and four values, which are the coordinates at which one can find
   this value. Meaing that the line `data[returned_index]` returns the first value above 0.9.

   ```python
   def first_after_val(data: np.ndarray, val: float=0.9) -> np.ndarray:
       """ Return the position of the first value larger than val """
   ```

## Tests

The tests for both questions are provided. Again, assignment grading is mostly based on the success
of the tests, for all three questions. I do reserve myself the right to lower (or raise) the grade under
some circumstances.
